# Approach

  The application displays the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. The clock updates every second to show the accurate time. Multiple alarms can be selected from dropdown menus by selecting the desired hour, minute, second, and AM/PM options. The alarms are stored in an array. An alarm sound is played when the current time matches any set alarms. The alarm sound is a ringtone audio file that loops until stopped. ***"Stop Alarm" button*** that allows the user to stop the currently playing alarm sound. This is useful when the user wants to silence the alarm without deleting it. Each alarm in the alarms list has a ***"Delete Alarm" button***, which removes the corresponding alarm from the array and updates the alarms list dynamically. ***"Reset Alarms" button*** that clears all set alarms. Clicking this button removes all alarms from the alarms list, resets the alarms array, and stops any playing alarm sound.
